We are a group of data enthusiast from various background including business, media marketing, statistics and engineering who aim to

* Use demographic, psychographic, attitudinal, and behavioral data to refine consumer targets and inform engagement strategies

* Brings consumer targets to life with vivid and complete profiles, including lifestyles, attitudes, brand preferences and media use

* Generate geographic nuances of consumers in all of America’s media markets, including purchase behavior, attitudes, lifestyles and much more.

* Develop a unique, media-neutral machine learning metric for detecting consumer trends in terms of planning, buying and selling

## Story

> DMA (Designated Market Area) regions are the geographic areas in the United States in which local television viewing is measured by The Nielsen Company. The DMA data are essential for any marketer, researcher, or organization seeking to utilize standardized geographic areas within their business in terms of:

|            Generation   Name           | Births Start | Births End | Age as of 2018 |
|:--------------------------------------:|:------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|
|        Baby   Boomer Generation        |     1946     |    1961    |     55 +       |
|            Generation   X              |     1960     |    1979    |     35 - 54    |
|            Millennials                 |     1980     |    1994    |     25 - 34    |
|                 Gen Z                  |     1995     |    2012    |     18 - 24  


Our Main Focus of this project is to compare Millennials& Gen Z and other generations' consumer behaviours.
Becuase Millennials and Gen Z grew up with smart phone and internet.  
Millenials are aging into a new lifestage as they start to get married settle down, and have families. 
Gen Z are aging from teenagers to young adults, they start graduating from college and getting the first job.

## Think before the demo day

- Why did you pick this problem?
- What was the datset like when you got it?
- What data cleaning did you have to do?

- Why did you your model?
- What did you find when the model
    predictive features
    Model tuning
    
- Why the choice of visualization/display

## Proposal

- This study, based on a behavioral data set of media indstry from 2013 - 2016, suggests that about 85% of the customer loyalty in terms of actual behavior can be predicted, in particular by demographic factors such as their generation group  
In the modern society, everyone is trying to make more money for living, and time has literally become more valuable.

Not everyone has time to go to the theatre and spend two hours to watch a movie, but people still need entertainment industry for relaxing and enjoying their lives.

Home entertainment is a more convenience and private way to attain the propose of entertaining.

“Most adults say they enjoy entertaining people in their home—an attitude that has remained constant for more than a decade. In the last three years, a substantial 77% of adults have hosted a party in their home. Informal gatherings are far more prevalent than formal parties, with 44% participation compared to 17%. Lifestyle trends, technology and social media influences, demographic factors, and motivations to host parties support the prevalence of informal gatherings.”

 By *-Dana Macke, Associate Director, Lifestyles & Leisure*

As the largest film industry in the world, in the United States people love movies, and enjoy watching movies at home. Our purpose is to track movie purchasers’ behaviors in different generations and genders.

Top Retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best & Buy, they are using data analysis and ML to target audiences, and do dynamic advertising targeting to raise awareness and to increase sales of the products.

On social media and websites, there are many sponsored ads and banners ads, most of them are targeting consumers who have specific behaviors. 
We pulled data from Simmon consumer behavior database, and list eleven behavior categories for movie purchasers (purchase dvd/blu-ray dics in past 12 months) in different generations ( Millennial, Gen X, Gen Y, Gen Z):
Video Games Players
Streaming Video Watchers
Digital Music Users
Cable TV Watchers
Radio Listeners
Magazine Readers
Movie Goers
Supermarket Shoppers
Tablet Owners
Live events Goers
Social Media Users

In the end of the project we made movie purchasers’ consumer behavior portfolio for each generations, and analyze each generations’ preference in each categories.

## Methodology: Random Forest Classifier

![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*tG-IWcxL1jg7RkT0.png)

## Findings

(1) South division is the winner in terms of population and most of the people are used to old school media such as Movies, Supermarket, TV, Magzine and Radio whereas younge generations are apprently stick to modernized media
        *South Division has more states include than others*

(2) Female takes the majority of the market share in all categories and Movies and Supermarkets are pretty much their backyards

(3) Comparing Gen Z and Baby Boomers, Gen Z is the minority which only contains 12.78% of the total population and only beats Baby Boomer in video game section; Baby Boomer buyers are tend to increase over time as they are mostly TV and Radio users but less likely enjoy video games

> The Simmons / Nielsen partnership allows advertisers, agencies, and media to go beyond demographics when profiling TV audiences. By integrating viewership of Nielsen-measured national TV programs and networks with the 60,000 variables available in the Simmons National Consumer Study, clients can illustrate compelling, data-driven stories about the true value of TV audiences.

> What is the difference between the Weighted and Unweighted Nielsen Sample?
> Weighted - The weights measure the number of people in the population that are represented by each member of the sample. For example, if sample member has a weight of 20,000 for a selected day, this means that on that day the sample member represents 20,000 in the population.
> Unweighted - If Unweighted is selected, then all analyses will function based on the unweighted sample. In other words, sample members will be weighted equally. Each sample member will effectively be assigned a weight of 1.
> When should I use the Weighted sample?
 
> As a rule of thumb, use the Weighted sample.  Weighted sample analysis, which is the default, is more accurate in representing the population, and should generally be used.
 
> When should I use the Unweighted sample?
 
> Unweighted sample analysis could be used if:
> You want to recreate an analysis that was made in Audience Watch version 5.73 or earlier.
> You really do want to see the viewing behavior of individual sample members.

* Note: US is divided into 7 divisions in terms of North East, East Central, West Central, South, South East, South West, Pacfic

* Limitation: 

    (1) The database doest contains any data in mountain division
    
    (2) The database doest contains Streaming Video data from 2013 to 2014
